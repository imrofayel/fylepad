You can try [web version here](https://fylepadapp.vercel.app/). I'd recommend using Desktop app for daily offline use. 

`fylepad` is your savior when other apps are too complex for simple tasks or too simple to even manage a basic to-do list. Designed for note-taking and Markdown-based editing, it strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power.

### üîÆ Features:

1. **Markdown-Based Rich Editing**: Create and edit notes with full Markdown support. From simple lists to advanced formatting. Change the `colors` & `fonts` as well.

3. **Auto-Save State**: Close the app anytime without worrying about losing progress. It remembers your work and restores it the next time you open the app.

4. **Export and Import**: Seamlessly export your notes to `PDF` or `Markdown` and import `.md` files back.

5. **Multi-Tab Support**: Open and work on multiple notes simultaneously with our tab-based interface.

6. Create tables, Mermaid diagrams, PlantUML charts, Code Blocks and much more.

7. **Rust Core**: Powered by a Rust core, it is fast, secure, and memory-efficient. No bulky Chromium browser under the hood here!

8. **Lightweight**: At just less than `10MB`, it is a compact powerhouse that won‚Äôt bloat your system.

With `light` and `dark` themes, you get a minimal looking note-taking app with bunch of features.

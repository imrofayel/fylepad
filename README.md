Sometimes, you want more than what you already have and sometimes little less. There are apps that are too complex for simple tasks, and some are too simple to even make a to-do list. So, 'Your savior is here!'.

Some of the features include extended Markdown based rich editing support, auto-save state so you can close the app anytime, and next time everything will still be there. You can export and import your notes in PDF, Markdown as well, tabs to support opening many notes at the same time and a spell checker.

And the best part? The app is just `5 MB`! Surprised? with its Rust core, it's blazing fast, secure, and memory-efficient — because we are not giving you a Chromium browser under the hood. 💥

This is just version `1.0` — there's a lot more to look forward to! Stay tuned! Feel free to reach out or follow me on GitHub. You can even join Rofayel Labs and become part of our team! 🕹️
